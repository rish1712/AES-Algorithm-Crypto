# AES-Algorithm-Crypto
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher. AES includes three block ciphers: AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. The above encrypts the plain text using AES-128
## Input Format
The first line contains the PlainText in the form of a string S (len(S)=32). The second line contains the Key for the encryption in the form of string K (len(K)=32)
